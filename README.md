# Note 2024-04-03: Updated README coming soon.

## The Great TODO List:

- [ ] Improve keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] Get the performance monitor working.
- [ ] Get the info modal added.
- [ ] Add opacity options for inner & outer geometries.
- [ ] Allow for negative outer geometry radii after adding opacity options.
- [ ] Add randomization options for the types of allowed theta and phi functions.
- [ ] Add style presets.
- [ ] Improve parameter history display.
- [ ] Move post-processing effects to their own control panel.
- [ ] Improve control panels.
- [ ] Put each control panel category into its own slide-out drawer.
- [ ] Figure out if I've got that torus math correct or not.
- [ ] Fix framerate issues caused by the "Every n Seconds" auto-randomize type.
- [ ] Handle evaluation errors.
- [ ] Handle invalid inputs functions for theta and phi.
- [ ] Improve math in SphericalTrochoid useFrame calculations.
- [ ] Come up with a better name than "Spherical Trochoids".
- [ ] Rename TController since it's doing more than just controlling "t".
- [ ] Improve project structure.
- [ ] Befriend a better mathematician, get them to review (and fix) my math, get math published.
